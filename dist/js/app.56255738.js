If his skill doesn\'t improve at all, that is not a problem of deliberate practice, it\'s a problem that he didn\'t practice the same skill every day. He is not practicing a specific skill (draw the eye of the portrait). Although the lack of feedback is also important, it\'s more important to focus on the same practice)","2":"The task of creating a portrait is a complex one and should be studied step by step rather than in full. Hence, Rajeev should identify what parts of the portrait are problematic and practice them regularly instead of drawing new full portrait every day.","3":"lack of deliberate practice, to say, always practice a general and broad task set without pinpointing where exactly is not good.","19":"To improve quickly, Rajeev needs deliberate practice, which requires feedbacks.","25":"No, because deliberate practice requires that an external agent provide feedback to the learner.","26":"Not exactly. To engage in deliberate practice, one must be given explicit instruction about the best method. Since Dan is simply reflecting on his own method and has never compared it with a best method given to him by an expert, this step is not met. You could perhaps argue that the second component of deliberate practice is met, he is his own teacher and diagnosis his own errors. But without the first point, this is meaningless. Finally, the third part of deliberate practice of getting informative feedback and remedial training could be argued that he\'s doing this for himself. But again, without being able to compare it with a best method, this is meaningless.","28":"no.there\'s no external resource to provide feedback to him","32":"No, for he is not supervised and has no instruction from experts.","33":"No, because there is not an external agent providing instructive and immediate feedback in Dan\'s practice","34":"Not receiving immediate feedback may make Rajeev not yield an improvement.","44":"No, he needs external agent to give informative feedback, as he may be \\"unskilled and unaware of it\\". Also he needs to receive informative feedback and practise again in a loop which he can not do in the described way.","50":"One of the most important things about growth mindset is giving feedback on the task that Mark is doing and not on his own personality of him being a talented musician. One growth mindset instruction his instructor could give him is \\"Great work in your performance today. Keep up with your perseverance.\\"","51":"Great job. Keep working and putting effort, you will improve more quickly.","53":"You did a great job putting efforts into practice and it paid off!","55":"Citing the recommended paper, \\"Growth-mind-set interventions convey that intelligence can grow when students work hard on challenging tasks—and thus that struggle is an opportunity for growth, not a sign that a student is incapable of learning.\\" Given that, option C seems correct as it shows that through struggling, Mark managed to improve his ability to keep the right rhythm.","56":"Amazing job! Great persistent on your learning.","57":"You have improved a lot!","66":"Great, you are doing well on this song because of your hard practice. You could do better on other songs and more complex skills if you continue to practice like this.","80":"Yes, because it gives them the confidence that they can master a concept enough to teach others and help others do well when tested on that concept.","82":"Yes indeed! The jigsaw method creates a growth mindset because through the process students are going through walks them through a process in which their own competence is demonstrated back to them and they are supported by the other students on their team. This translates to them feeling their own ability to succeed and increase their intelligence in the future.","83":"Yes, students are encouraged to learn , express, they are seeing others rely on themselves and see themselves improve.","84":"No, because usually, students don\'t realize why it works","86":"I think it does. Especially for those low-achieving students, Jigsaw enables them to learn from other members (in the expert group as well as Jigsaw group), knowing that they could also learn as well as their peers. Also, as Jigsaw team will rely on one another to learn that part of knowledge, each person will feel that they are making contributions.","90":"Yes, for example carlos, have developed a growth-mindset, while he thought he was stupid he later think he is smart.","91":"According to the reading, Carlos changed his mindset because his groupmates think he was someone they could work with and someone they could appreciate."},"Question_id":{"0":1,"1":1,"2":1,"3":1,"19":1,"25":2,"26":2,"28":2,"32":2,"33":2,"34":2,"44":2,"50":3,"51":3,"53":3,"55":3,"56":3,"57":3,"66":3,"80":4,"82":4,"83":4,"84":4,"86":4,"90":4,"91":4},"Student_score_on_question":{"0":0,"1":0,"2":0,"3":0,"19":1,"25":0.5,"26":0.75,"28":0.75,"32":0.75,"33":0.75,"34":0.75,"44":1,"50":0.25,"51":0.75,"53":0.75,"55":0.75,"56":0.5,"57":0.5,"66":1,"80":0,"82":0,"83":0,"84":1,"86":0,"90":0,"91":0},"Student_choice_on_question":{"0":"B","1":"B","2":"B","3":"B","19":"A","25":"C, D","26":"B","28":"B","32":"B","33":"B","34":"B","44":"B, C","50":"A, C, D","51":"B","53":"B","55":"D","56":"B, C","57":"B, C","66":"B, D","80":"A","82":"A","83":"B","84":"C","86":"A","90":"A","91":"B"},"Quiz_score":{"0":6,"1":8.5,"2":8,"3":6.75,"19":6.75,"25":8.5,"26":6.75,"28":8.75,"32":6.75,"33":6.75,"34":4.75,"44":6,"50":6,"51":7,"53":9,"55":7,"56":7,"57":8,"66":9,"80":8,"82":7.5,"83":8,"84":7.75,"86":7,"90":6.5,"91":7.75},"Average_quizzes_score":{"0":7.8,"1":8,"2":8.1,"3":6.7,"19":7,"25":8,"26":7.2,"28":7.7,"32":6.9,"33":6.7,"34":6.7,"44":7.3,"50":6.4,"51":6.8,"53":7.7,"55":8.1,"56":8.3,"57":7.7,"66":8,"80":7,"82":8.1,"83":8,"84":7.3,"86":6.8,"90":7.7,"91":6.9},"Question_text":{"0":"Every morning, Rajeev spends an hour alone drawing a portrait from a photograph in the day’s newspaper to improve his portraiture skills (skills drawing a portrait).
